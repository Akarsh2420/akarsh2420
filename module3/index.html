<h2>Chicken</h2> 

He heard calm strides behind him. That didn't look good. Who could be following him this late around evening time and in this loser part of town? What's more, at this specific second, soon after he pulled off easy street and was grabbing the greenbacks. Was there another hooligan who'd had a similar thought, and was currently watching him and sitting tight for an opportunity to get his reward for all the hard work? Or then again did the means behind him imply that one of numerous law officials around was on to him and simply holding back to jump and snap those sleeves on his wrists? He apprehensively glanced in general. Unexpectedly he saw the back street. Like lightning he shot off to one side and vanished between the two stockrooms practically falling over the receptacle lying in the asphalt. He attempted to anxiously tap his way along in the inky obscurity and unexpectedly hardened: it was an impasse, he would need to return the manner in which he had come. The means got stronger and stronger, he saw the dark layout of a figure coming around the bend. Is this the stopping point? he thought squeezing himself back against the divider attempting to make himself undetectable in obscurity, was all that arranging and energy squandered? He was dribbling with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the dread falling off his garments. Unexpectedly close to him, with a scarcely perceptible squeak, an entryway swung discreetly forward and backward in the night's breeze. Could this be the asylum he'd appealed to God for? Gradually he slid toward the entryway, squeezing himself increasingly more into the divider, into the dim, away from his adversary. Would this entryway save his hide?He heard calm strides behind him. That didn't look good. Who could be following him this late around evening time and in this lowlife part of town? What's more, at this specific second, soon after he pulled off easy street and was snatching the greenbacks. Was there another hooligan who'd had a similar thought, and was currently watching him and sitting tight for an opportunity to snatch his reward for so much hard work? Or then again did the means behind him imply that one of numerous law officials around was on to him and simply holding on to jump and snap those sleeves on his wrists? He apprehensively glanced for what it's worth. Out of nowhere he saw the back street. Like lightning he shot off to one side and vanished between the two distribution centers practically falling over the canister lying in the asphalt. He attempted to apprehensively tap his way along in the inky obscurity and abruptly solidified: it was an impasse, he would need to return the manner in which he had come. The means got stronger and stronger, he saw the dark layout of a figure coming around the bend. Is this the stopping point? he thought squeezing himself back against the divider attempting to make himself imperceptible in obscurity, was all that arranging and energy squandered? He was dribbling with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the dread falling off his garments. Unexpectedly close to him, with a scarcely observable squeak, an entryway swung unobtrusively forward and backward in the night's breeze. Could this be the shelter he'd petitioned God for? Gradually he slid toward the entryway, squeezing himself increasingly more into the divider, into the dull, away from his foe. Would this entryway save his hide?He heard calm strides behind him. That didn't look good. Who could be following him this late around evening time and in this miscreant part of town? Also, at this specific second, soon after he pulled off easy street and was snatching the greenbacks. Was there another evildoer who'd had a similar thought, and was presently watching him and hanging tight for an opportunity to get his reward for all the hard work? Or then again did the means behind him imply that one of numerous law officials around was on to him and simply standing by to jump and snap those sleeves on his wrists? He anxiously glanced in general. Abruptly he saw the rear entryway. Like lightning he dashed off to one side and vanished between the two distribution centers practically falling over the canister lying in the asphalt. He attempted to apprehensively tap his way along in the inky haziness and abruptly hardened: it was an impasse, he would need to return the manner in which he had come. The means got stronger and stronger, he saw the dark framework of a figure coming around the bend. Is this the stopping point? he thought squeezing himself back against the divider attempting to make himself imperceptible in obscurity, was all that arranging and energy squandered? He was dribbling with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the dread falling off his garments. Unexpectedly close to him, with a scarcely observable squeak, an entryway swung unobtrusively forward and backward in the night's breeze. Could this be the safe house he'd appealed to God for? Gradually he slid toward the entryway, squeezing himself increasingly more into the divider, into the dim, away from his adversary. Would this entryway save his hide?He heard calm strides behind him. That didn't look good. Who could be following him this late around evening time and in this miscreant part of town? What's more, at this specific second, soon after he pulled off easy street and was snatching the greenbacks. Was there another convict who'd had a similar thought, and was presently watching him and hanging tight for an opportunity to get his reward for all the hard work? Or on the other hand did the means behind him imply that one of numerous law officials around was on to him and simply standing by to jump and snap those sleeves on his wrists? He anxiously glanced in general. Abruptly he saw the rear entryway. Like lightning he shot off to one side and vanished between the two distribution centers practically falling over the receptacle lying in the asphalt. He attempted to apprehensively tap his way along in the inky dimness and abruptly solidified: it was an impasse, he would need to return the manner in which he had come. The means got stronger and stronger, he saw the dark layout of a figure coming around the bend. Is this the stopping point? he thought squeezing himself back against the divider attempting to make himself undetectable in obscurity, was all that arranging and energy squandered? He was dribbling with sweat now, cold and wet, he could smell the dread falling off his garments. Out of nowhere close to him, with a scarcely recognizable squeak, an entryway swung discreetly forward and backward in the night's breeze. Could this be the safe house he'd appealed to God for? Gradually he slid toward the entryway, squeezing himself increasingly more into the divider, into the dim, away from his adversary. Would this entryway save his stow away?
